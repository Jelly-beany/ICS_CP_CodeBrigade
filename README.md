<br><b>NOW how do you operate the code?</b><br>
  rule 1) do not tamper with names of the c codes or it will result in total failure<br>
  rule 2) follow exactly as what is being said on the console though code is made resilient to silly mistakes of voters<br>

<b>first we have 3 C CODES and 2 TXT FILES</b>

  1)votingproject.c      {operated by the voter}<br>
  2)adminvotesystem.c    {operated by admin to check votes}<br>
  3)votingprojectfunctions.c  {dont tamper or harm contains all necessary functions to run above 2 codes}<br>

  4)datauserin.txt    {contains all inputs of users, it is fixed defined dont change name/info i.e. any chnge to name will fail the system though it will run}<br>
  5)problemstatement.txt    {contains the voting statement that is going to be presented to voter}<br>


<b>WORKING:</b>

//this part is basically saying follow the console just read the headings but if you want to know more you can read extra too

      voter is allowed to run (1) i.e votingproject.c and follow the instructions on console
        just in case im mentioning some of them
        1)ID should be written in small letters only
        2)ID should be valid (code is written to handle irregular users so it will ask to write again)
        basically this is child's play please just follow what is said on thre console
      
      admin is allowed to run (2) i.e adminvotesystem.c and follow the instructions on console
        just in case please put big console to observe it neatly
      
//upto you if you wanna update voting problem statement like "VOTING FOR PRIME MINISTER" you can use bellow instructions

      problemstatement (5)
        actual vote system is given with a preupdated problem statement but you can put a new one too follow the instructions to do so
        step 1)first line should contain only the number of candidates and the a new line character is to be given
        step 2)from next line you can write the statement for voting like mentioned in the above comment 
        step 3)it is suggested to write candidate with a correspnding SERIAL number for it to properly work
        step 4)you can write any thing but remenber, how you write will exactly be printed on console
        step 5)if you are going to give new data here it is beter to delete all text/data in DATAUSERIN.TXT so both works together
        

//there is an EASTER EGG in the process on how to exit code if you dont wanna vote you can find that out for yourselves by checking code or within three days it will be revealed on the repository (06/12/2023)

//only for enthusiasts passage 

  code is made to tackle various wrong formats of giving id but its not entirely resislient, you can try out for yourselves on what to give and test resilience as voter.
  clear screen function employed makes this 100x better than usual codes along with bold script etc..
